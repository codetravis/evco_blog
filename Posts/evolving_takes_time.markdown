Recently, I have begun working on a web development project for a friend.  It is a relatively straightforward idea targeted towards the education market.  After sketching it up on paper, I thought it would be relatively easy to create a HTML and CSS prototype for him.  Boy was I wrong.  

The problem is not that I cannot do it or don't have the ability, it is that I simply have not done enough of it to be fast.  I am having to look up things that a more experienced web designer would probably know off the top of their heads.

## Evolving for Developers is a Function of Volume of Work

Natural evolution is said to have occured over billions of years.  Obviously, we don't have that long to get better at programming. Besides, the evolution you want to see in your programming will not come about purely as a result of time, but as a result of the amount of work you do, which takes time.

Just as natural evolution occurs over time, programming ability evolution occurs over work.  The more work you do, the closer you get to that highly evolved state that is a competent programmer.

This is not a new idea and does not just apply to programming. Jeff Atwood on his [blog](http://www.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/) has several posts about the volume of work that needs to be done.  [Jon Jagger](http://jonjagger.blogspot.com) wrote a bit for 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know called [Do Lots of Deliberate Practice](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Do_Lots_of_Deliberate_Practice). The title says it all.

## Mistakes

As you do large amounts of work, you make mistakes. Think of these mistakes as bad branches in the evolutionary tree.  They are necessary as you iterate to find what works and what doesn't.  And even though you may find something that works, later on a better, more efficient technique may come along and that branch will fall off.

But one day you realize that you can code that up in an afternoon, you see the problem more quickly, you start rejecting the unneccessary features earlier.

That is my goal and the purpose of this blog.  To give new and growing developers an example of what it is like to go through those bad branches and then make course corrections in the evolutionary tree.
