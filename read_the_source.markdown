#Read the Source

I have read and heard this quite a bit in my short time as a programmer.  It really hit me today as I was working on a little project that incorporated the useful little [Chartjs](http://www.chartjs.org) library.

This was my first time using this library and usually when using something for the first time I try to follow a tutorial or two to get familiar with it a little bit.  The tutorial/documentation on this website was a little limited and I couldn't see where I needed to add the change I wanted to make. I was making a little line chart for two different sets of numbers
